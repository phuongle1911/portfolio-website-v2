# portfolio-website-v2
Hi, Welcome to my personal portfolio website version 2!
There are some changes in this website compared to the Wireframe design.
## - Color theme
I choose a brighter color theme to make the website more attractive. 
## - Contact links arrangement (Email, Linkedin, Github)
Contact links arrangement are moved to the header, and header position is fixed. In this way, the visitor can always click on these links to get more information about me anytime when they browse the website. 
I believe that the more convenient for them to contact me, the better. 
## - Animation elements
There are two animation elements created:
Animated gradient background for Home page: this makes the website more attractive. The same color theme is used for this gradient to keep the main website color theme. 
Animated arrow at Home page: this is to show that there are more content when the visitor scroll down the web page. 

Hope you enjoy the website!
